# gitleaks ignore file
# This file contains fingerprints of secrets that should be ignored
# To ignore a secret, run gitleaks detect and copy the fingerprint from the output
# Then add it here, one per line
#
# Example:
# abc123def456...
#
# Note: File patterns don't work here. Use .gitleaks.toml for path-based allowlists
# or use inline comments: # gitleaks:allow
